    <h1>Week 4 – Finalising Phase 1: Sketches, Website Plan & Personas</h1>

  <main>
    <p>This week, I wrapped up the final elements of <strong>Phase 1: Research & Planning</strong>.</p>

    <p>I completed a set of <strong>project sketches</strong> and visual references inspired by both fictional elements (Omashu from <em>Avatar</em>) and real-world architectural systems (modular housing, kinetic façades, biomimicry-based ventilation). These sketches helped clarify the structure and flow of the speculative city I will now begin modelling in Maya.</p>

    <p>I also developed the <strong>website structure</strong>, outlining the main sections: <em>Project Overview</em>, <em>Simulation</em>, <em>Research</em>, <em>Data</em>, <em>Thesis</em>, and <em>Contact</em>. This will act as the core presentation format for the final work.</p>

    <p>Lastly, I created my <strong>persona profiles</strong>, defining key user types such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An <strong>urban planner</strong> seeking visual communication tools for disaster resilience</li>
      <li>A <strong>climate-focused architect</strong> interested in adaptive systems</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each persona helped focus the narrative and function of the simulation. With all these components finalised, Phase 1 is now officially complete, and I’m ready to move forward with Maya testing and animation.</p>

    <h2>🗂️ Website Structure Overview</h2>
    <p>As part of finalising Phase 1, I mapped out the structure of my project website, which will serve as the main platform for presenting <em>Seismic City: A Data-Driven Maya Simulation of Adaptive Architecture</em>.</p>

    <p>The site will combine animation, research, data, and thesis documentation in an engaging and accessible format. It guides viewers through the full journey—from conceptual inspiration to technical realisation.</p>

    <h3>📑 Planned Website Structure</h3>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Section</th>
          <th>Content</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Home</strong></td>
          <td>Project title, short summary, and teaser video loop</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Project</strong></td>
          <td>Overview of Seismic City, goals, and design influences</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Simulation</strong></td>
          <td>Maya animations, breakdowns of adaptive systems, and how movements respond to real data</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Research</strong></td>
          <td>Summarised literature review, biomimicry and kinetic systems, and design theory</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Data</strong></td>
          <td>Seismic data visualisations, graphs, and downloadable datasets</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Thesis</strong></td>
          <td>5,000-word PDF download, with chapter navigation and highlights</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Contact / About</strong></td>
          <td>Personal info, course details, and credits</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>This structure balances visual engagement with academic rigour. The site will act as both an exhibition tool and a comprehensive archive of my work.</p>

    <h2>👥 Personas & Purpose</h2>
    <p>I developed two key <strong>user personas</strong> that represent the primary audiences for my project <em>Seismic City</em>.</p>

    <p>These personas help define who the project is for, how it serves their needs, and how it could be used beyond this academic submission. I also clarified the broader <strong>project purpose</strong>.</p>

    <h3>👤 Persona 1: Lina – Urban Planner (Age 42)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Background:</strong> Works at a city council focusing on urban development and climate adaptation</li>
      <li><strong>Goals:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Communicate spatial risk visually</li>
          <li>Develop future-proof infrastructure tools</li>
          <li>Advocate for clear design visuals</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Frustrations:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Reports are hard for non-experts to understand</li>
          <li>Limited access to simulation tools</li>
          <li>Hard to visualise “resilience” to stakeholders</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>How Seismic City Helps:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Cinematic visualisation of disaster-response systems</li>
          <li>Bridge between design and policy</li>
          <li>Shows modular systems in action</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>👨‍🎓 Persona 2: Theo – Architecture Student (Age 24)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Background:</strong> Final-year student in creative computing & architecture</li>
      <li><strong>Goals:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Explore speculative design and urban futures</li>
          <li>Apply data to creative projects</li>
          <li>Build an interdisciplinary portfolio</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Frustrations:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Traditional architecture lacks interactivity</li>
          <li>Few animated or speculative case studies</li>
          <li>Limited exposure to data+design workflows</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>How Seismic City Helps:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Connects fantasy-inspired design with engineering</li>
          <li>Inspires modular and kinetic thinking</li>
          <li>Demonstrates Maya for data-driven visualisation</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🎯 Project Purpose</h3>
    <p><em>Seismic City</em> explores how speculative architecture—rooted in fantasy—can be translated into real-world adaptive systems using 3D simulation and scientific data. By grounding the project in real seismic behaviour, architectural theory, and kinetic design, it provides a prototype of how modular cities might respond dynamically to natural disasters.</p>

    <p>The project aims to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🌍 Engage the public in climate and disaster awareness</li>
      <li>🏙️ Provide a tool for urban resilience communication</li>
      <li>📚 Inspire students and designers to think across disciplines</li>
    </ul>
