    <p>This week I shifted from data-driven simulations to a more visually oriented design process. Rather than using real datasets, I focused on building a believable environment through strong reference research, stylised modelling, and environmental storytelling.</p>

    <p>I began by exploring various platforms for inspiration—500px, ArtStation, DeviantArt, Pixiv, and Pinterest—searching for landscape compositions, architectural styles, and colour palettes. Once I had gathered enough references, I used <strong>DALL·E</strong> to generate specific concept sketches based on my vision for the city. These AI-generated visuals helped solidify ideas for my 3D design and gave me a creative baseline for building assets.</p>

    <p>From there, I began modelling in <strong>Blender</strong>, starting with a low-poly house design. Once the core structure was complete, I explored different websites to gather high-quality materials and assets to enhance the model. I used <strong>Poly Haven</strong> to source textures and furniture elements, which added realism and depth to the house interior and exterior.</p>

    <p>With the building in place, I turned my attention to the <strong>landscape design</strong>. I conducted additional research and a brief literature review on unusual urban topographies. Inspired by the <strong>Azores Islands</strong>, which are built on volcanic land yet still support thriving communities, I decided to locate my fictional city on a <strong>mountainous terrain</strong>. This choice supports the project’s narrative goal—to communicate that not all cities are built in ideal or safe locations, yet urban life adapts and flourishes regardless.</p>

    <p>This week laid a strong foundation for both the architectural style and environmental identity of my fictional city.</p>
