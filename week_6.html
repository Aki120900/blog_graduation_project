    <p>With the formative review approaching, I focused this week on preparing all essential deliverables.</p>

    <p>I finalised my SMART goals, MoSCoW prioritisation list, Gantt chart, and literature review. In addition, I gathered relevant materials such as data visualisations, Maya animation tests, and initial concept sketches.  
    These were compiled into a single submission folder and showcased through my newly built website using <strong>Astro</strong>.</p>

    <p>The site features dedicated sections for the simulation, research insights, data overlays, and thesis documentation. I also rehearsed my presentation outline, ensuring I could clearly communicate the connection between data and design throughout my workflow.</p>
