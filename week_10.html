  <main>
    <p>This week, I dedicated my full attention to building and refining the project website using <strong>Astro</strong>. With most visual and animated content prepared, my focus shifted toward <strong>structuring the site</strong>, <strong>embedding final materials</strong>, and <strong>ensuring everything worked cohesively</strong> as a single educational experience.</p>

    <p>I developed key pages for each section of the project—simulations, video demonstrations, interactive content, and written research. This included uploading animations, formatting blog entries, adding captions, and embedding the AI-generated scenes to illustrate real-world disaster scenarios.</p>

    <p>The interface was designed to be accessible and engaging for younger audiences. I tested various layouts and navigation styles to ensure that the site was both visually inviting and intuitive to use. Accessibility and clarity were prioritised throughout, particularly for sections that explained complex ideas such as architectural vulnerability or emergency responses.</p>

    <p>By the end of the week, most of the <strong>site structure was in place</strong>, and I began populating it with final assets—videos, images, Markdown content, and breakdown diagrams—to prepare for submission and exhibition.</p>
