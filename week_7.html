    <p>This week marked a significant shift in my project direction. After attending several peer presentations and speaking in detail with my supervisor, I realised that the original target audience—skilled professionals in related industries—would require a far more technically advanced and precise simulation. Additionally, the product I was proposing would need to be something entirely new to them, which posed challenges in terms of feasibility and scope.</p>

    <p>Following these discussions, I redefined my project's purpose and shifted the focus to a more appropriate beneficiary group: <strong>young children and teenagers</strong>. The aim became educational—helping this demographic to better understand natural disasters through interactive, visual learning tools.</p>

    <p>Initially, I explored the idea of creating a city in a 3D simulation environment and layering natural disaster scenarios over it. This led to transitioning from Maya to <strong>Blender</strong> as my primary tool, due to Blender’s flexibility and available extensions. I experimented with add-ons such as <strong>Blosm</strong>, <strong>Blender GIS</strong>, and a few <strong>online city generators</strong>. However, I quickly discovered limitations: many of these tools provided pre-built cityscapes, which made it difficult to integrate realistic and responsive disaster simulations.</p>

    <p>As a result, I decided that I would need to <strong>build my own city from scratch</strong>—which brought me back to a concept I had previously explored: <strong>Omashu</strong>, a fictional city with strong architectural and geographic identity.</p>

    <p>To support this change, I conducted additional literature review focused on <strong>seismic-resistant buildings</strong>. Why buildings? Because after analysing real-world data and creating visualisations, I noticed that <em>the greatest financial impact of natural disasters is often related to the destruction and rebuilding of buildings</em>. Therefore, I chose to focus on structures first—developing earthquake-aware architecture—and gradually expand the simulation to include the surrounding environment.</p>

    <p>Two examples that inspired my design direction were <strong>Meteora</strong> in Greece (known for its cliff-perched planning) and <strong>Dukezong</strong> in China (noted for its traditional timber-based seismic architecture). These references provided cultural, geographical, and structural insights that will influence how I design my fictional city moving forward.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, I decided that the project would culminate in a <strong>website that serves as an educational guide</strong> for young people. The platform will offer a variety of engaging learning methods, including <strong>interactive elements</strong>, <strong>videos of simulations</strong>, and <strong>real-world data overlays</strong> to provide a realistic understanding of natural disasters. The goal is to create an accessible, informative, and visually compelling experience that communicates both the risks and recommended actions during emergencies.</p>
