    <p>In the final week of the project, my primary focus was ensuring that <strong>the entire website was functioning smoothly and ready for submission</strong>. I encountered several technical issues related to <strong>video and image loading</strong>, which required troubleshooting and adjustments to file formats, compression methods, and hosting paths. These challenges were time-consuming but essential to overcome in order to deliver a smooth and fully responsive experience for users.</p>

    <p>Once all core sections were working correctly—including the simulation videos, AI-generated scenes, and educational overlays—I published the final version of the website. This marked a key milestone, as the platform now presents the complete learning journey in a structured, accessible, and visually engaging format.</p>

    <p>After publishing, I shifted my full attention to the <strong>thesis</strong>. I revisited earlier chapters and dedicated time to <strong>rewriting and refining</strong> my arguments, improving clarity, structure, and coherence. Particular emphasis was placed on explaining the evolution of the project, the reasons behind major changes (such as the shift in beneficiaries), and how design and research informed each other.</p>

    <p>By the end of the week, I had a working version of both the website and thesis, aligned in tone and purpose, ready for final review and submission.</p>
