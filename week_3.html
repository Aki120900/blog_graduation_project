    <h1>Week 3 – SMART Goals, MoSCoW & Gantt Chart</h1>
    <p>Published: 2025-03-07 | Tags: planning, management</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>This week was all about project management.</p>
    <p>I created SMART goals to define key milestones and ensure that each task is achievable within my timeline. I also used the MoSCoW method to prioritise project features and deliverables—from essential animations and data visualisations to optional extras like voiceovers and interactive elements.</p>
    <p>A Gantt chart has been built to visualise the full development process, and it’s already helping me manage scope and workflow expectations.</p>

    <hr/>

    <h2>🎯 SMART Goals</h2>
    <p>Here is my SMART goals with achievable dates based on the timeline:</p>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Goal #</th>
          <th>SMART Statement</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>1</strong></td>
          <td>Research and define 3 real-world adaptive architecture systems (biomimicry, kinetic structures, modular housing) by <strong>14 March 2025</strong>.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>2</strong></td>
          <td>Collect and clean 2–3 seismic datasets and create visual graphs by <strong>21 April 2025</strong>.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>3</strong></td>
          <td>Sketch 3 modular/adaptive city layout concepts and start modelling basic components in Maya by <strong>5 May 2025</strong>.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>4</strong></td>
          <td>Learn core Maya tools (Bifrost, MASH) and complete 1 animated prototype responding to data by <strong>10 May 2025</strong>.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>5</strong></td>
          <td>Build the website structure and upload initial visuals, project sections, and navigation by <strong>15 May 2025</strong>.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>6</strong></td>
          <td>Working on documentation and final stages by <strong>25 May 2025</strong>.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>These goals are now aligned with the revised development plan and ensure I stay on track.</p>

    <h2>📌 MoSCoW Prioritisation</h2>
    <p>To stay focused and ensure I'm developing the most critical elements first, I’ve used the <strong>MoSCoW method</strong> to prioritise features and deliverables for my graduation project: <em>Seismic City – A Data-Driven Maya Simulation of Adaptive Architecture</em>.</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Priority</th>
          <th>Feature / Deliverable</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Must Have</strong></td>
          <td>Maya-based 3D animation simulating disaster response, seismic data input driving movement, final project website, and 5,000-word thesis</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Should Have</strong></td>
          <td>User persona profiles, data overlays and graphs, infographic breakdowns of animation logic</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Could Have</strong></td>
          <td>Voiceover narration or audio design, animated interface mockups, environmental soundscapes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Won’t Have</strong></td>
          <td>Real-time 3D city viewer, AR feature, Unity/VR prototype (outside current scope)</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>By focusing first on the “Must Haves”, I ensure the core simulation experience—based on architectural theory and seismic data—is successfully realised in Maya and clearly communicated through a fully documented website and thesis.</p>

    <h2>📈 Gantt Chart & Timeline</h2>
    <p>To manage the scope and complexity of my graduation project <em>Seismic City</em>, I’ve created a 13-week Gantt timeline that mirrors both my academic structure and personal workflow. This timeline aligns with each project phase, from early research to final submission and exhibition.</p>

    <p><strong>Task Status:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>✔️ Completed</li>
      <li>🔄 In Progress</li>
      <li>⏳ Upcoming</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>📆 Weekly Timeline Breakdown</h3>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Week</th>
          <th>Task</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>Week 1</strong></td><td>Ideation & Planning – Finalised project concept, reference inspiration, and feasibility.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Week 2</strong></td><td>Literature Review – Reviewed works on biomimicry, kinetic architecture, modular housing, and data visualisation.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Week 3</strong></td><td>SMART Goals, MoSCoW, and Gantt Chart – Created project framework and prioritisation list.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Week 4</strong></td><td>Completed Project Sketches, Website Structure Outline, and Persona Definitions to finalise Phase 1.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Week 5</strong></td><td>Data Gathering – Collected seismic datasets, cleaned and created basic visualisations.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Week 6</strong></td><td>Website Setup – Built basic project website, added structure, and compiled files for formative assessment (due 23 April).</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Week 7</strong></td><td>Maya Testing – Testing MASH and Bifrost, early structure rigging, and city sketching.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Week 8</strong></td><td>Start modelling adaptive city components in Maya; refine sketches and scene layout.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Week 9</strong></td><td>Finalise Maya rigs and connect animation to data behaviours (e.g. quake/flood reactions).</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Week 10</strong></td><td>Polish simulation scenes, prepare main animation for rendering.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Week 11</strong></td><td>Start rendering full animation; begin adding content to website.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Week 12</strong></td><td>Finalise video and web visuals; test website navigation and load times.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Week 13</strong></td><td>Complete documentation report, submit all deliverables, and prepare for exhibition presentation.</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>This plan keeps the project on track while allowing flexibility for testing and refinement. Each phase builds directly on the previous, ensuring that research informs design, and design responds to real-world data.</p>
