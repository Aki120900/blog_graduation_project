    <p>This week I finalised the mountain landscape for my fictional city and decided to add a <strong>small fishing village</strong> near the coastline to make the environment feel more lived-in and dynamic. This additional detail helped enhance the realism and cultural identity of the city.</p>

    <p>Following this, I began testing <strong>natural disaster simulations</strong> using Blender’s <strong>geometry nodes</strong> and <strong>physics tools</strong>, particularly focusing on <strong>cyclones and tsunamis</strong>. Unfortunately, the results were not as successful as I had hoped. The behaviour lacked realism, and I found it difficult to achieve the level of control and visual quality necessary for my educational goals.</p>

    <p>As a result, I pivoted from procedural simulation to a more <strong>cinematic approach</strong>. I developed a concept in which the camera would fly through the city, showcasing the environment, and then pause at key points to introduce different types of natural disasters. This storytelling format would allow for greater clarity, control, and engagement—especially for younger audiences.</p>

    <p>To support this, I created an <strong>animated ocean surface</strong> and began building the full camera movement using Blender’s <strong>Fly Navigation</strong> tool. After trying several techniques, I found this method to be the most accurate and flexible for my city-wide tour.</p>

    <p>Once satisfied with the scene flow, I moved on to <strong>rendering the animations</strong>, preparing to compile them into an educational film. To expand the visual content further, I also explored <strong>AI-generated video tools</strong>. I tested <strong>LTX Studio</strong>, which allowed me to generate <strong>mini scenes based on text prompts</strong>. Using this tool, I recreated short sequences inspired by real events—<em>Japan 2011</em>, <em>Alaska 1958</em>, and <em>Severo-Kurilsk 1952</em>—which I plan to integrate into the website as additional learning materials.</p>

    <p>These AI-generated sequences help convey the <strong>real-world severity of natural disasters</strong>, adding a historical and emotional layer to the visual learning experience.</p>
